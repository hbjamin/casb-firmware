# How to build PetaLinux (and software) from a Vivado project

### Instructions
- Open Vivado
```bash
vivado_2023
vivado
```
- Open project
- `Program and Debug` --> `Generate Bitstream`
- `File` --> `Export` --> `Export Bitstream File` and name it `casb_tester.bit`
- `File` --> `Export` --> `Export Hardware` --> `Include Bitstream`
- From the `casb/` directory create the PetaLinux project
```bash
petalinux-create -t project -n casb.linux --template zynq
```
- From Adrian's project copy `/petalinux/configs/config` and `/petalinux/configs/rootfs_config` to `casb.linux/project-spec/configs/`
- Move the exported `.xsa ` and `.bit` files to `casb/casb_tester`
- Grab the exported `.xsa` and `.bit` files
```bash
petalinux-config -p casb.linux/ --get-hw-description casb_tester/
```
- In the graphical menu that pops up, confirm **Image Packaging Configuration - Root filesystem type - EXT4** has been properly selected from the configuration files (this ensures the image will boot from an ext4 partition on the SD card).
```bash
petalinux-config -p casb.linux/ -c rootfs
```
- In the graphical menu that pops up, confirm that the choices in the `rootfs_config` file are reflected here (there are several filesystem ulitiies that will be marked for install based on the file).
- Check that `project-spec/meta-user/recipes-bsp/device-tree/files/system-user.dtsi` is empty. If custom device drivers are desired, or if a property of an existing hardwaer device (e.g the SD card controller) needs to be modified, this file can be modified.
- From Adrian's project copy `petalinux/recipes/regtest/` to `casb.linux/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-apps/` to add a simple user application to the build. This is donw by creating an app template as in the https://xilinx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/A/pages/18842475/PetaLinux+Yocto+Tips#PetaLinuxYoctoTips-CreatingApps(whichuseslibraries)inPetaLinuxProject. 
- From Adrian's project copy `/petalinux/confix/user-rootfsconfig` to `project-spec/meta-user/conf/` to ensure that user application are included in the root file system.
- Build the project. This will take multiple hours the first time.
```bash
petalinux-build -p casb.linux -c petalinux-image-full
```
- Don't worry if you get `INFO: Failed to copy built images to tftp dir: /tftpboot`
- I found that the build images were located `casb.linux/build/images/linux` instead of `casb.linux/images/linux`, so copy them to the correct location
```bash
cp -r casb.linux/build/images casb.linux/images
```
- Package the image to create the output file `casb.linux/images/linux/BOOT.bin`
```bash
petalinux-package -p casb.linux/ --boot --u-boot --fsbl casb.linux/images/linux/zynq_fsbl.elf --fpga casb.linux/images/linux/system.bit -o casb.linux/images/linux/BOOT.bin
```
- If `system.bit` cannot be found...
```bash
cp casb_firmware/casb_tester.bit casb_firmware/casb.linux/build/images/linux/system.bit
```
- One time I found I didn't have the correct permission to write in the folder all of a sudden... no idea why but this fixes it
```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/Xilinx/casb/
```
- Test the build from the `casb.linux` directory 
```bash
petalinux-boot --qemu --u-boot
```
