# IP directory (This path could be hardcoded into create_project.tcl like the src directory currently is, but it is left here in case the IP directory is one day moved to a separate repository in order to be version controlled like the ip repository used for the CTB. Doing something like that would be beneficial if one wanted to use different versions of the same IP block for different experiments. On the other hand since this project is not nearly as complicated as the CTB, one could also just create a separate IP block for each experiment and put them all in the same repository, which is what I am going to do for now.) - B.
